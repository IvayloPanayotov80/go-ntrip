The rtcm package contains logic to read and decode and display RTCM3
messages produced by GNSS devices.  See the README for this repository
for a description of the RTCM version 3 protocol.

     import (
         "github.com/goblimey/go-ntrip/rtcm/handler"
     )

imports the code for handling RTCM messages.

     rtcmHandler := handler.New(time.Now(), logger)

 creates an RTCM handler connected to a logger.

To process data, create a buffered channel of bytes for input
and a buffered channel of RTCM messages for output and start the handler:

    ch_source := make(chan byte, channelSourceCapacity)

    ch_result := make(chan Message, channelResultCapacity)

    go rtcmHandler.HandleMessages(ch_source, ch_result)

The handler reads bytes from the input, converts them to RTCM messages, each with a message type, and sends the messages to the message channel.
Any interspersed data that's not in RTCM format is returned as a special type NonRTCMMessage.
The handler runs until ch_source is closed.
If the bit stream is coming from a live GNSS device this may never happen
and the handler will run until the application is forcibly shut down.

Some RTCM messages
contain a timestamp,
milliseconds from the start of some period.
at the end of the current period,
the timestamp rolls over to zero and
another period starts.  To make sense of the
timestamps, the handler needs a date within the period in which the data
was collected.  If the handler is receiving live data, the current
date and time can be used, as in the example.

Each rtcm.Message object contains the raw data of the message
and the message type.  The raw data is binary and tightly
encoded.  The String method displays the data in a readable format.

    message.String()

Most message types are displayed as a hex dump with the message type.  Accurate positioning uses message type 1005 (base station position)
and the Multiple Signal Messages or MSMs (observations of signal from satellites).

As well as producing a hex dump of the data,
the String method decodes these messages in greater detail,
showing the various fields and their meaning.
For example, an MSM gives
the transit time of each signal from the
satellite to the base station in three fields which have to be combined together.
This is represented in the display as a distance in metres.

In this example,
the message is type 1087, a Glonass Multiple Signal Message.
It was sent on the 1st January 2021 in the early morning. 

    Message type 1097, Galileo Full Pseudoranges and PhaseRanges plus Carrier to Noise Ratio (high resolution)

The satellites broadcast different signal types on different
frequency bands.
My receiver is dual band,
meaning that it listens for signals on two frequency bands.
In this case it received type 2 signals and type 15 signals
from 7 satellites.
Each satellite has an ID and in this case
satellites 1, 3, 13, 14, 15, 21 and 27 were in view.
The receiver doesn't always pick up every signal
but this time it did,
14 in all.

In the signal list, the first number is the distance to the satellite in metres.
This is derived from the transit time.
Notice that the distance is a little different for the two signals
even though they are coming from the same satellite
and were sent at the same time.
That's because each signal was distorted by the ionosphere.
Different frequencies are distorted differently
so the signals traveled through two different paths,
one longer than the other.
The receiver analyses these discrepencies to figure out
the distortion and correct for it,
allowing it to better estimate its position.
